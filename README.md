# Statistical Analysis and Regression in Java

This Java project generates random data, calculates Pearson correlation coefficients, and builds a linear regression model. 
It splits data into training and test sets, computes predictions, and evaluates performance using SSE (Sum of Squared Errors).

## ðŸš€ How to Run
Open `LinearRegression.java` in your Java IDE (NetBeans, IntelliJ, Eclipse), compile, and run. 
The program outputs correlation coefficients, the regression equation, and SSE for training and test data.
